# **Tomasz Kacprzak's homepage**
-------------------------------------

<br>

I am a senior researcher at ETH Zurich, as well as having worked at the University College London and the University of Manchester.

My focus is testing cosmological models using novel statistical and machine learning techniques.

# Projects
-----------------------------


## Cosmology and Artificial Intelligence

I am the PI of the production project "Measuring Dark Energy with Deep Learning" programme at the Swiss Supercomputing Center (CSCS).

I was the PI of the ["Deep Learning for Observational Cosmology"](https://datascience.ch/project/deep-learning-for-observational-cosmology-dloc/) programme at the Swiss Data Science Centre.

## Forward modelling of telescope images

I have worked on building end-to-end simulations of various telescope images, using parametric models for galaxy populations.
I have pioneered the use of Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques to constrain galaxy population models with simulations.
I worked on DES, CFHT and Subaru results, as well as statistical and computations techniques enabling the practical use of this approach.

## Weak gravitational lensing analysis

The full cosmological lensing analysis is complex: starting from understanding the effects affecting the pixels in the telescope camera, through modelling of atmospheric image distortions, measuring shapes of galaxies, and simulation-driven systematic errors control. Finally, I am exploring novel methods of extracting information from weak gravitational lensing datasets with Convolutional Neural Networks.

I am involved in the Dark Energy Survey project, which is currently observing the southern sky to create the largest galaxy survey to date: [www.darkenergysurvey.org](www.darkenergysurvey.org).
