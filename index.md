# Data science, cosmology, physics


I am a Senior Scientist at [ETH Zurich](https://www.cosmology.ethz.ch) and a Senior Data Scientist at the [Swiss Data Science Center](https://www.datascience.ch) at the [Paul Scherrer Institute](https://www.psi.ch). I obtained my PhD in Physics and Astronomy from the University College London, as well as previously a MSc in Machine Learning from the same university.
My focus is applications of novel machine learning and high-performance computing to solve outstanding problems in physics, cosmology, and climate science.

# Projects

###  Cosmology and artificial intelligence
Artificial Intelligence methods, such as deep convolutional neural networks, have the capacity to model the complex patterns contained in the cosmic web. I have introduced the deep learning appraches to constraining cosmological parameters and generating large scale structure simulations.

- I performed the first cosmological analysis with deep learning, on KiDS-450 dataset ([Phys. Rev. D 100, 063514](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.100.063514), with Janis Fluri), which was promoted by [ETH News (18/09/2019)](https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2019/09/artificial-intelligence-probes-dark-matter-in-the-universe.html) and [MIT Techology Review (19/09/2019)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/09/19/446/facial-recognition-algorithms-can-be-deployed-to-hunt-for-dark-matter/). 
- I was the PI of the production project "Measuring Dark Energy with Deep Learning" at the Swiss Supercomputing Center (CSCS), producing the CosmoGrid simulations, available at [www.cosmogrid.ai](http://www.cosmogrid.ai).
- I was the PI of the ["Deep Learning for Observational Cosmology"](https://datascience.ch/project/dloc/) programme at the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC).
- I was the lead organizer for the workshop ["Artificial Intelligence Methods in Cosmology"](https://sites.google.com/site/aicosmo2019/), held in Monte Verita, Ascona, 9-12 June 2019.

### Dark Energy Survey

I am a Bilder of the [Dark Energy Survey](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org), the largest ground-based cosmological observational survey to date. I have been involved in DES since 2012, with the following contributions:

- As the Simulations Working Group coordinator and a memeber of the Science Committee (2022-), I organize new projects and collaboration in the area of simulation-based inference and provide CosmoGridV1 simulations,

- I led the first simulation-based inference cosmology mesurement with DES, using shear peaks and the Science Verification dataset ([MNRAS 2016 463, 4, 2016](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/463/4/3653/2646308)), followed by the full survey area analysis in DES Year 3 ([MNRAS 511, 2, 2075-2104, 2022](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/511/2/2075/6511572)),

- I worked extensively on galaxy shape measurements for weak gravitational lensing, image simulations, and noise biases in shear measurements, and contributed significantly to DES Science Verification weak lensing analysis [arxiv.org/abs/1507.05603](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05603).

### Machine learning for applied physics 

At PSI, I work on a number of projects advancing the applications of machine learning to applied physics:

- I lead of the collaborative project "Robust and scalable Machine Learning algorithms for Laue 3-Dimensional Neutron Diffraction Tomography" at the PSI. Our novel approach to indexing of polycrystalline diffraction patterns from neutron tomography is capable of analyzing 10x larger samples with 100x gain in speed, compared to prevsious methods. The upcoming package LaueOT will avalilable at [Github](https://github.com/LaueOT/laueotx).

- I am building novel approaches for finding diffraction spots from detector images, using simulations-based pre-trained models and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation.

### Climate simulations compression

I am the lead data scientist at SDSC's contribution to the Exclaim project. I am developing fast and versatile methods for compressing massive climate simulations, aiming at 1 km resolution maps produced by the upcoming Alps supercomputing cluster at CSCS. I am investigating possible applications of machine learning techniques to aid the efficiency and accuracy of climate simulations.

### Forward modelling of telescope images

I have worked on building end-to-end simulations of various telescope images, using parametric models for galaxy populations. I have pioneered the use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) techniques to constrain galaxy population models with simulations. I worked on DES, CFHT and Subaru results, as well as statistical and computational techniques enabling the practical use of this approach.

### Weak gravitational lensing analysis

The full cosmological lensing analysis is complex: starting from understanding the effects affecting the pixels in the telescope camera, through modelling of atmospheric image distortions, measuring shapes of galaxies, and simulation-driven systematic errors control. I developed the first integrated, simulation-based approach for joint measurement of cosmological lensing shear power spectra and the redshift distributions of the galaxy sample. This method used massive Monte Carlo Contol Loop simulations, inspired by the approaches in particle physics. I led the team at the ETH Zurich that applied this methodology to the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 cosmology measurement.
