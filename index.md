I am a post-doctoral researcher at the **ETH Zurich**, as well as having worked at the University College London and University of Manchester.

This site is under construction.

My focus is testing cosmological models with weak gravitational lensing.
The full cosmological lensing analysis is complex: starting from understanding the effects affecting the pixels in the telescope camera, through modelling of atmospheric image distortions, measuring shapes of galaxies, and simulation-driven systematic errors control.
I am exploring novel methods of extracting information from weak gravitational lensing datasets via, for example, shear peak statistics and deep learning.

I am involved in the Dark Energy Survey project, which is currently observing the southern sky to create the largest and galaxy survey to date: <a href="http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/">www.darkenergysurvey.org</a>
