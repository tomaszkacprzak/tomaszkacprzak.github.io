# **Tomasz Kacprzak's homepage**
-----------------------------

I am a senior scientist at ETH Zurich, as well as having worked at the University College London and the University of Manchester.
I also recently joined the [Swiss Data Science Center](www.datascience.ch) as Senior Data Scientist to intiate a new office at the Paul Scherrer Institute ([PSI](www.psi.ch)).

My focus is testing cosmological models using novel statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Projects
-----------------------------


### Cosmology and Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence methods, such as deep convolutional neural networks, have the capacity to model the complex patterns contained in the cosmic web.
I have introduced the deep learning appraches to constraining cosmological parameters and generating large scale structure simulations.
 * I am the PI of the production project "Measuring Dark Energy with Deep Learning" at the Swiss Supercomputing Center (CSCS).
 * I was the PI of the ["Deep Learning for Observational Cosmology"](https://datascience.ch/project/deep-learning-for-observational-cosmology-dloc/) programme at the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC).
 * I was the lead organizer for the workshop ["Artificial Intelligence Methods in Cosmology"](https://sites.google.com/site/aicosmo2019/), held in Monte Verita, Ascona, 9-12 June 2019.

### Forward modelling of telescope images

I have worked on building end-to-end simulations of various telescope images, using parametric models for galaxy populations.
I have pioneered the use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) techniques to constrain galaxy population models with simulations.
I worked on DES, CFHT and Subaru results, as well as statistical and computational techniques enabling the practical use of this approach.

### Weak gravitational lensing analysis

The full cosmological lensing analysis is complex: starting from understanding the effects affecting the pixels in the telescope camera, through modelling of atmospheric image distortions, measuring shapes of galaxies, and simulation-driven systematic errors control. Finally, I am exploring novel methods of extracting information from weak gravitational lensing datasets with Convolutional Neural Networks.
I am involved in the Dark Energy Survey project, which is currently observing the southern sky to create the largest galaxy survey to date: [www.darkenergysurvey.org](www.darkenergysurvey.org).
