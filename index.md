<!--   Hi! this is just a sample **intro text**. You would normally put your [full name](about/) here and say something *smart* about yourself. -->

<!--  This could also be the good place to say were you are coming from, what you [do for a living](work/) and maybe what you are [interested in](projects/). You might also be [writing](articles/) about stuff. -->

<!--  But after all this is your site and I'm just a **placeholder text** so what would i know about some *home page content*. -->
