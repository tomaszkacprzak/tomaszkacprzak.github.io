# **Tomasz Kacprzak's homepage**

I am a senior researcher at ETH Zurich, as well as having worked at the University College London and the University of Manchester.

My focus is testing cosmological models using novel statistical and machine learning techniques.

# Projects

I am the PI of the production project "Measuring Dark Energy with Deep Learning" programme at the Swiss Supercomputing Center (CSCS).

I was the PI of the ["Deep Learning for Observational Cosmology"](https://datascience.ch/project/deep-learning-for-observational-cosmology-dloc/) programme at the Swiss Data Science Centre.

The full cosmological lensing analysis is complex: starting from understanding the effects affecting the pixels in the telescope camera, through modelling of atmospheric image distortions, measuring shapes of galaxies, and simulation-driven systematic errors control. Finally, I am exploring novel methods of extracting information from weak gravitational lensing datasets with Convolutional Neural Networks.

I am involved in the Dark Energy Survey project, which is currently observing the southern sky to create the largest galaxy survey to date: [www.darkenergysurvey.org](www.darkenergysurvey.org).

<!--  This could also be the good place to say were you are coming from, what you [do for a living](work/) and maybe what you are [interested in](projects/). You might also be [writing](articles/) about stuff. -->
